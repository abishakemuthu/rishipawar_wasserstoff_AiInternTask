![Text Sum](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55caa3e0-e400-477f-af4b-86d878d90e11)

## Objective

Developed an automated text summarization pipeline to extract concise summaries and key insights from domain-specific PDFs. Implemented parallel processing and efficient error handling to optimize performance for large document sets. Integrated MongoDB for structured storage of metadata, summaries and keywords.

## Principles

- Our application has to process single or multiple pdf which will be uploaded by user.

- It should display the metadata to the user interface.

- It should process the text present in the pdf and give concise summary according to the length of pdf text.

- It should extract the keywords from the document given to it.

- It should calculate the processing time and display it to the user for measuring performance.

- It should save the metadata, extracted summary and keywords to the mongodb Atlas which can be extracted later for analysis purpose.
